php-signature-generator
=============

This is a standalone PHP signature image generator for [MCStats](https://mcstats.org).

It pulls data from MCStats using the API, and so can be used anywhere.

**Note:** This uses a new unfinished version of the MCStats API. It currently pulls data from the staging server, which may not be online or have up to date data at a given point in time.
